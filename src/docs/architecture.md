# Architecture of the Drone Control System

## Overview
The Drone Control System is designed to facilitate the monitoring and control of drones through a control station interface. It integrates various components including simulation environments, machine learning for object detection, and advanced navigation techniques such as GPS estimation and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).

## System Components

### 1. Control Station
The control station serves as the user interface for interacting with the drone. It includes:
- **GUI**: A graphical user interface for user interactions.
- **Dashboard**: Displays real-time telemetry data and drone status.
- **Communication**: Utilizes ZeroMQ for efficient message passing between the control station and the drone.

### 2. Drone Package
This package contains the core functionalities for drone operations:
- **Controller**: Manages drone commands and state transitions.
- **Telemetry**: Collects and processes telemetry data from the drone.
- **Commands**: Defines the various operational commands that can be sent to the drone.

### 3. Simulation
The simulation package allows for testing and development in a virtual environment:
- **Gazebo Interface**: Interacts with the Gazebo simulation environment for realistic drone behavior.
- **ArduPilot Interface**: Communicates with ArduPilot for executing real drone commands.

### 4. Machine Learning
This component focuses on enhancing the drone's capabilities through machine learning:
- **Object Detection**: Implements algorithms for detecting objects in the drone's environment.
- **Models**: Defines the machine learning models used for detection tasks.
- **Training**: Contains functions for training the machine learning models.

### 5. Navigation
The navigation package is responsible for guiding the drone:
- **GPS**: Handles GPS coordinate estimation and processing.
- **SLAM**: Implements SLAM algorithms for mapping and localization.
- **Pathfinding**: Provides algorithms for efficient navigation and obstacle avoidance.

### 6. ZeroMQ Communication
The ZeroMQ package facilitates communication between different components:
- **PubSub**: Implements the publish-subscribe pattern for broadcasting messages.
- **ReqRep**: Implements the request-reply pattern for direct communication.

### 7. Utilities
Utility functions and classes that support the overall application:
- **Config**: Manages configuration settings.
- **Logging**: Provides logging functionalities for monitoring and debugging.
