Can you build a ZeroMQ-based server for a drone system that uses pymavlink? The server should manage the following components:

1. Camera Stream Management

- Stream the raw camera feed frames through a ZeroMQ publisher.
- Stream the processed camera feed through a ZeroMQ publisher.


2. Hook Controller System (for package delivery)

- Implement a drop hook command (to release payload) 
- a raise hook command (to retract the hook).
- Both commands should be ZeroMQ-triggered and acknowledged with telemetry data from the drone.

3. MAVLink Communication Relay

Bridge MAVLink messages from the droneâ€™s serial port into the ZeroMQ message bus.

Forward relevant commands from ZeroMQ clients back into the drone using pymavlink.



4. Mission Command Interface

Include a mission command (e.g., "kamikaze") to send the drone to a specified GPS coordinate at high priority.

Command should be ZeroMQ-triggered and acknowledged with drone telemetry via the same system.




Everything should be modular and asynchronous, with clear message routing and logging.
